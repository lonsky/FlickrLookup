# FlickrLookup
Simple application that allows to perform public photos lookup on Flickr

Just build and run :)

Deployment target at the moment is iOS9.3. It's possible to use lower versions 8.X (didn't test though)

# Evolution/Improvements:
- involve UI designer :)
- imrove error processing code/parser errors;
- add ability to swipe through big photos
- try to do batch reload for thumbnails (this should improve responsiveness of the collection view);
- localization
- support different responses format (XML, etc.)
